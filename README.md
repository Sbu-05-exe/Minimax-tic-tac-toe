# Tic Tac Toe

### description
This programme is a java based Tic-Tac-Toe game using javafx.

This game can be played both using a GUI (javafx) and a CLI. The code with architected using OOP in such a way that it could be easily ammended. Features that I hope to implement in future is 

* allow user to edit the settings of the game (name of players), colour of shape?
*  allow user to play against a Bot that can't lose
*  host the game on a network and play over it

### installation

Run in terminal
Simply clone this repository and run the Game.java file using the conventional java commands that you would use to run a java programme. 

Run GUI: 
I am a novice at javafx so I don't know if I would be able to set up this on anther machine. If you would like to tinker around and get this working on your machine then you must at least have 

* the javafx sdk downloaded somewhere on your machine
* an environment variable called PATH_TO_FX
* run the commands in build.sh 

NOTE the build.sh file is a linux bash file, so if you are on windows just change the file extension to .bat and you should be able to get something working...
